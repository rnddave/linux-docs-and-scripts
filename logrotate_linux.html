 <h3>Log files on Linux</h3>

 <p>
	On Linux several processes are creating log files.
	These logfiles can become very larege.
	Therefor maintenance is needed on the log files to refresh or shrink them.<br>
	The Linux OS uses a utility to maintain the several log files. This utility
	is called <b>logrotate</b>.<br>
	This document describes how to use the logrotate utility for the Lummus log files
	on the Linux machines.
 </p>

 <p>
	On RedHat Linux the logrotate utility is started as a cronjob (/etc/crontab).
	The job runs every day (/etc/cron.daily/logrotate).<br>
	Logrotate reads the configuration from the file <b>/etc/logrotate.conf</b>
	and the files in the directory <b>/etc/logrotate.d</b>. With this information
	it will clean the logfiles of several applications running on the machine.<br>
 </p>

 <p>
	The default installation of Linux will not clean the Lummus specific logfiles.
	To use logrotate for this purpose there are 2 approaches:
	<ol>
		<li>Create logrotate config files in /etc/logrotate.d</li>
		<li>Create separate config files in /usr/applic/spt/ITS/etc</li>
	</ol>
	The disadvantage of the first is that it becomes unclear what the Lummus
	specific environment is and what belongs to the OS. Also at what time the
	job will run can not be changed.<br>
	The second option has the disadvantage that a separate cronjob must be created.<br>
	Choosen is for the first option:
	<ul>
		<li>Create the file /etc/logrotate.d/lummus that contains lummus log files</li>
		<li>Easy to copy/restore</li>
		<li>No extra Scheduling</li>
	</ul>
 </p>

	A view examples of the Lummus logrotate configuration file:
		<table border class=pre_view><tr><td><pre>
#do the defaults
/home/$USER/log/test0.log {
        missingok
}

#do not create an empty new file
/home/$USER/log/test1.log {
        nocreate
        missingok
}

#create an empty new file
/home/$USER/log/test2.log {
        create
        missingok
}

#create an empty new file with a mode, optionally a user and group
/home/$USER/log/test3.log {
        create 666
        missingok
}

#for a process thats keeps the file open. The log file will keep the inode:
/home/$USER/log/test4.log {
        missingok
        copytruncate
}

#copy the rotated log file to a separate directory
/home/$USER/log/test5.log {
        missingok
        olddir old
}

#keep the original file
/home/$USER/log/test6.log {
        daily
        missingok
        copy
}
